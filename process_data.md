## Process images for *mini*ImageNet and *tiered*ImageNet.

As the `ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar` file is very large and hard to download for some researchers because of the internet condition, we provided the processed images for *mini*ImageNet and *tiered*ImageNet.

You may download them via Google Drive. As the *mini*ImageNet and *tiered*ImageNet are sampled from the ImageNet dataset, You need to be granted access for non-commercial research/educational use. By accessing the data, you have to agree to the following terms.

```

Researcher may provide research associates and colleagues with access to the Database provided that they first agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.
Princeton University and Stanford University reserve the right to terminate Researcher's access to the Database at any time.
If Researcher is employed by a for-profit, commercial entity, Researcher's employer shall also be bound by these terms and conditions, and Researcher hereby represents that he or she is fully authorized to enter into this agreement on behalf of such employer.
