## Download Few-Shot Datasets

You may download the datasets on Google Drive and 百度网盘. As the *mini*ImageNet and *tiered*ImageNet are sampled from the ImageNet dataset, you need agree to the terms of ImageNet:

3. Researcher accepts full responsibility for his or her use of the Database and shall defend and indemnify the ImageNet team, Princeton University, and Stanford University, including their employees, Trustees, officers and agents, against any and all claims arising from Researcher's use of the Database, including but not limited to Researcher's use of any copies of copyrighted images that he or she may create from the Database.
4. Researcher may provide research associates and colleagues with access to the Database provided that they first agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.
5. Princeton University and Stanford University reserve the right to terminate Researcher's access to the Database at any time.
6. If Researcher is employed by a for-profit, commercial entity, Researcher's employer shall also be bound by these terms and conditions, and Researcher hereby represents that he or she is fully authorized to enter into this agreement on behalf of such employer.
